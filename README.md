Deadline: 28-11-2024
Objective: Familiarize yourselves with Git and GitHub, and collaboratively build a multi-page website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Instructions:
Set Up the Repository:
Ahmed will create a new GitHub repository named collaborative-website.
Ahmed will set up the basic structure with the following files (ALL INITALLY EMPTY):
Index.html
about.html
pricing.html
Contact.html
Shop.html
styles.css
script.js
Mohamed will create a README.md file with the project overview and instructions, i.e a copy of this page in md.
Invite Collaborators:
Ahmed will add Dileep, Shajith, Khabbab, and Mohammed as collaborators on the GitHub repository.
Clone the Repository:
Clone the repository to your local machine using:
git clone github-link/collaborative-website.git
Branching:
Create your own branch from the main branch to work on your assigned page:
git checkout -b yourname-[page-name]
Implement Pages:
Ahmed: Home Page (index.html)
Dileep: About Page (about.html)
Shajith: Pricing Page (pricing.html)

Each one of you will do your own styles and scripts in common files (styles.css, script.js)

Commit and Push:
Commit your changes to your branch:
git add .
git commit -m "Added [page-name] page"
git push origin feature-[page-name]
Pull Requests:
Create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the main branch.
Review each other's PRs, Each person provides at least one feedback, and the one on the receiving end makes changes as necessary.
Once approved by me, merge the PRs into the main branch.
Merge and Test:
After all pages are merged, pull the latest changes from the main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
Open the website in your browser to ensure all pages work and integrate seamlessly.
Final Review:
Perform a final review of the complete website.
Resolve any conflicts or issues.
Push the final version to the main branch.
Documentation:
Now Dileep will update the README.md file with a brief description of the website, instructions for running the project locally, and a list of contributors.
